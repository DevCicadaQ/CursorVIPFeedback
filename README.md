> **About Project**: Cursor VIP is a tool for automating the registration and activation process of Cursor IDE. The project aims to provide automatic account creation and activation, helping developers get quick access to Cursor features. This is my first serious project, and I'm learning as I go!

> **From Author**: Hi! I've just started my journey in development and created this project to explore automation possibilities. I hope this tool will be useful for other developers. I chose Cursor IDE as an excellent example for learning and practice.
> This is my research project and personal experiment. The code is closed as I'm still learning and developing the project.

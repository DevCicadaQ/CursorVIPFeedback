# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I trust this application?

This application is developed for regular users and has no malicious intent. It only performs the functions specified in the description - there is no spying or theft of personal data. Although the source code is closed, this does not mean that the application is unsafe.

If you are using Windows and your antivirus marks the application as potentially dangerous, this is a false positive. There are no such problems on macOS and Linux. The application uses legitimate methods to work with Cursor IDE, which some Windows antiviruses may mistakenly identify as malicious activity. A detailed technical explanation can be found in this discussion: https://github.com/DevCicadaQ/CursorVIPFeedback/issues/16

You can check the security of the application yourself by uploading its file to the VirusTotal service (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload). This service checks files using antivirus engines and provides a detailed security report. This will help you ensure there is no malicious code in the application.

## Cursor VIP is not working. What should I do?

## What data does the application collect?

To improve product quality, I collect a minimal set of technical data: number of application launches, operating system version, and system language. This information helps me better understand my audience, prioritize feature development, and create better updates for specific user groups. I use all collected data exclusively to improve compatibility and product development.

Collection of this basic technical data is standard practice for software and does not require separate user consent because:
- The data is anonymized and cannot identify a specific user
- The collected information relates only to technical system characteristics
- Collection is necessary to ensure application functionality and compatibility

No personal data or confidential information is collected or shared with third parties.

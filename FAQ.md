# FAQ

## How can I trust this application?

This application was developed for regular users and has no malicious intentions. It only performs the functions specified in the description - there is no spying or theft of personal data. Although the source code is closed, this does not mean that the application is unsafe.

You can verify the application's safety yourself by uploading its file to VirusTotal service (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload). This service checks files using antivirus engines and provides a detailed security report. This will help you ensure there is no malicious code in the application.

## How to get the code?

To get the serial number, watch the video carefully until the very end. A pop-up banner with the serial number will appear in the upper right corner of the screen. The hint will only be displayed for a few seconds, so please be extra attentive not to miss it.

## Why do I need a code?
This is intentionally done to restrict access to the application. Only genuinely interested users who are willing to carefully watch the video and find the code will be able to use the program. This approach helps filter out casual users.

## What data does the application collect?

To improve product quality, I collect a minimal set of technical data: number of application launches, operating system version, and system language. This information helps me better understand my audience, prioritize feature development, and create higher quality updates for specific user groups. I use all collected data exclusively to improve compatibility and product development.

Collection of this basic technical data is a standard practice for software and does not require separate user consent because:
- The data is anonymized and cannot identify a specific user
- The collected information only relates to technical system characteristics
- Collection is necessary to ensure application functionality and compatibility

No personal data or confidential information is collected or shared with third parties.

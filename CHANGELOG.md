But no worries — I've created a **brand new one** where I’ll be sharing cool **coding videos**, ideas, and side projects!

## ⚠️ New Rules for Users *Without a Unique Code*

To keep things fair and sustainable, I’ve added a few limits:

- ⏳ You might need to **wait 1–7 minutes** before using the tool  
- ⏰ You can run it only **once every 24 hours**

---

## 🏆 Have a Unique Code? You’re All Set!

If you already have a code — **nothing changes for you**.  
You get full access, no waiting, no limits.

Curious how to get one?  
Check out the details here: [LIMIT.md](https://github.com/DevCicadaY/CursorVIPFeedback/blob/main/LIMIT.md)

# 🚀 Support the Project!

Hello, friends!

Thank you to everyone who installs and uses the application — your activity inspires and gives strength to move forward. However, I notice that support on **YouTube** remains minimal: there are few subscriptions, likes and comments.

⚠️ **Important:** without your feedback and engagement on YouTube, it's becoming increasingly difficult to develop the project.  

If the situation doesn't change in the coming days, I will have to suspend public updates of the application.

### 📢 How you can help:
- Subscribe to the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DevCicadaY)
- Like the latest video
- Leave a short comment

Every action you take contributes to the future of this project.  
**Thank you for your understanding and support!** 🙏

- 🐞 Improved stability and fixed bugs

🔒 Improved application security and protection

## 2.0.11

🔧 Fixed critical bugs

## 2.0.10

### ⚠️ Important Warning
**Before launching the application, make sure to save all tabs in Google Chrome**, because:

All open tabs **will be closed**  
You may lose **unsaved data**

### 🔌 Token Issue Fix
**Problem:** token **does not update automatically** due to non-working authorization server
This leads to **inability to log in** to **Cursor IDE**

### 🛠️ Solution

#### 1. If token **did not update automatically**:
The program will **launch Google Chrome** with a **temporary profile**  
Profile will be stored in a **temporary folder**  
And will be **automatically deleted** after completion

#### 2. Authorization Process:
**Wait for login completion** on the website (authorization process will be visible)  
After successful login **return to Cursor IDE**  
Click the **"Log in"** button and complete authorization

#### 3. After that you can continue working as usual

### 🔐 Machine ID
The program **automatically changes the machine ID** to a unique one at each launch
This helps avoid device limitations

### 🪟 For Windows Users
You may need to **run as administrator** for all features to work correctly

### ⚡ Additionally
The program may work **unstably**

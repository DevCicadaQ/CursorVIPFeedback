# Limitations and Support System

👋 Dear users! I want to share important information about new project protection measures. Looking at the statistics, I noticed a significant imbalance between the number of downloads and community activity. To ensure sustainable project development, I have introduced a system of limitations.

## Current Usage Rules
- 🔒 First launch is available immediately after download
- ⏳ Subsequent launches are possible with a 24-hour interval

## Reasons for Limitations
- 🛡️ Protection against mass non-targeted usage

# 📋 Project Usage Rules

## 👋 Introduction
Hello! This project has specific usage conditions.

## 🔄 Improved Activation Code Retrieval Rules

📝 To get **access** to my tool, carefully **watch my YouTube video**.  
The activation code is formed from **special parts** that can be collected **only through careful viewing**.

This mechanism is designed to **support my channel** and attract **truly interested users**.

### Why is this important?

✅ The activation code is not just a random set of characters, but a **test of your motivation and attentiveness**.  
✅ Only those who truly want to use the tool will be able to **collect and enter the correct code**.  
❌ For everyone else — the path is closed.

If you are **not ready to make an effort** — it's better to **not waste your time**.  
My tool is designed for those who are ready to **learn, experiment** and **implement new opportunities**.

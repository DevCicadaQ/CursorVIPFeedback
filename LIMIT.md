# üìã Rules of Use

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BEFORE USING THE APPLICATION, PLEASE READ THE INFORMATION

**Hello!** First and foremost, I strongly recommend purchasing the official subscription to [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/pricing) before using my application. For students, there is a special [subscription program](https://www.cursor.com/students).

**It's important to understand** that you **should not look for ways to bypass restrictions**, especially when it comes to a **high-quality product**. If you are in a **difficult financial situation** or live in a **country with a low income level**, you can use my application, but I ask you to approach this **responsibly**. The application is created for those who **really cannot afford a monthly subscription**. If you have the opportunity to purchase an official subscription - **please do so**.

Now about the project itself. I developed it for educational purposes, to better understand the principles of such systems and improve my development skills. **It is important to emphasize the key point**: the project was created exclusively for professional development and self-learning.

1. **üö® Key condition**: The project is created exclusively for educational purposes with the goal of professional growth
2. I reserve the right to terminate access to the application at any time without prior notice
3. Possible instabilities in operation, as the project is in an active development stage and is constantly being improved
4. The application does not contain malicious code, despite possible antivirus warnings, and is completely safe
5. You can independently verify the security
6. The source code of the project is closed and not subject to public distribution

**I have also made significant changes to the access system.** **Now access is provided only after passing automatic verification.** **There is also a project support code that can only be obtained from the video!**

**My philosophy is simple**: you can use the application to **improve your skills and learn** by passing all necessary verification stages. **However, commercial use is strictly prohibited!**

# Limitations & Support System

👋 Dear users,
I’d like to share some important updates about new protection measures in the project. After analyzing usage statistics, I noticed a significant imbalance between downloads and actual community engagement.
To ensure sustainable development, a limitation system has been introduced.

## Current Usage Rules
- 🔓 First launch is available immediately after download
- ⏳ Next launches are available with a 24-hour interval

## Why These Limitations Exist
- 🛡️ To protect against mass, untargeted usage
